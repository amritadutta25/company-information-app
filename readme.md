## Project Description

>The project aims to build a website to report company financial data based on user input. We are using a financial API called Alpha Vantage to retrieve data about the company like company name, company description, company location and some key statistics about the company.

## Technologies Used:

> HTML | CSS | JavaScript | jQuery

## Details about the API

We are going to use the API: 
<!-- with two different endpoints as below: -->

- `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&symbol=IBM&apikey=demo`: This returns a json array with all the company details and overview

<!-- - `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=IBM&outputsize=compact&apikey=demo`: This returns a json array of daily time series data. -->

Sample Fetch/Ajax called:
```js
const url = "https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&symbol=IBM&apikey=demo"
fetch(apiURL)
.then((res) => res.json())
.then((data) => console.log(data))
```

The Data I get back:
```json

## Mockup
The website has a homepage with company name and description.
The website will have a search bar where user inputs the ticker they want to know about.
Once we receive the request, the website will display an overview of the company like its name, location, asset type, plus some stats like 52 week high trading price, 52 week low trading price.
