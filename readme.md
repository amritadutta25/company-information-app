## Description on Project

>The project aims to build a website that displays information about a ticker the user wants to know about. We are using a financial API called Alpha Vantage to retrieve data like daily price, company name, company description, company location etc.


## Details about the API

We are going to use the API with two different endpoints as below:

- `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&symbol=IBM&apikey=demo`: This returns a json array with all the company details and overview

- `https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol=IBM&outputsize=compact&apikey=demo`: This returns a json array of daily time series data.

Sample Fetch/Ajax called:
```js
const url = "https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=OVERVIEW&symbol=IBM&apikey=demo"
fetch(apiURL)
.then((res) => res.json())
.then((data) => console.log(data))
```

The Data I get back:
```json
